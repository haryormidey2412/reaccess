                Alert box is used to give any important information to the user. <br>It gets invoked after a specified 
                event and the webpage becomes unoperational until alert box is over the webpage.

                and then the CSS/HTML of the selected element can be changed by using innerHTML property with it.<br>
                This property helps in doing changes even after the webpage gets loaded completely.<br>
                The id attribute selects the HTML element with that particular id and the innerHTML property<br>

    <h1>Define 10 other reserved JS keyword and what they do.</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">In any programming language, a reserved word or a reserved identifier is a word that cannot be used as an identifier,
        such as the name of a variable, function, or label. Thus, it is reserved and cannot be used for defining any
        of these. This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning

    <h1>What are the differences and similarities between let, var and const?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Differences Between Let, Var, Const</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Var</th>
            <th>Let</th>
            <th>Const</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It has been traditionally used to declare variables in JavaScript. It is function scoped, 
                which means a variable declared inside a function is visible throughout the function. 
                If var is used outside a function, it becomes a global variable. One key issue with using var 
                is that it allows redeclaration of the same variable, which could be an unintentional mistake.
            </td>
            <td>
                It was introduced in ES6 and is block scoped, which means a variable declared inside curly 
                braces {} can not be accessed from outside. Also, let cannot be redeclared within the same scope. 
                One important thing to note is that let can be updated in the same block.
            </td>
            <td>
                is also introduced in ES6 and like let, it is also block scoped. The only difference is 
                that const cannot be reassigned within the same scope. This means if a JavaScript 
                variable is declared with const, it cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table><br><br>
    <h1>Similarities between Var, Let, Const</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">
        Variables declared with const , just like let , are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope 
        but without a default initialization. var variables, as you've seen earlier, are hoisted with a default value of 
        undefined so they can be accessed before declaration without errors.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>With relevant examples, explain the difference between the three ways you can identify string in JS.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Single-quoted Strings(''): It is the easiest way to define a string. It can be used it when you want the string to be 
    exactly as it is written. All the escape sequences like will be output as specified instead of having
    any special meaning. Single-quote is usually faster in some cases.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Double-quoted strings(""): By using Double quotes the code is forced to evaluate the whole 
    string. The main difference between double quotes and single quotes is that by using double quotes, you can include 
    variables directly within the string. It interprets the Escape sequences. Each variable will be replaced by its value.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Backslash(``) The backslash indicates that the next character should be treated as a literal character rather than as a special 
    character or string delimiter.</p>
